## To upload a file to Cloud Storage, you first create a reference to the full path of the file, including the file name.

```
// Create a root reference
const storage = getStorage();



```
- #### we used this in registerd file
- here we use username (displayname) in this 2nd perameter
    ('images/rivers.jpg')
```

import { getStorage, ref, uploadBytesResumable, getDownloadURL } from "firebase/storage";

const storage = getStorage();
                        
const storageRef = ref(storage, 'images/rivers.jpg');

const uploadTask = uploadBytesResumable(storageRef, file);

// Register three observers:
// 1. 'state_changed' observer, called any time the state changes
// 2. Error observer, called on failure
// 3. Completion observer, called on successful completion
uploadTask.on('state_changed', 
  (snapshot) => {
    // Observe state change events such as progress, pause, and resume
    // Get task progress, including the number of bytes uploaded and the total number of bytes to be uploaded
    const progress = (snapshot.bytesTransferred / snapshot.totalBytes) * 100;
    console.log('Upload is ' + progress + '% done');
    switch (snapshot.state) {
      case 'paused':
        console.log('Upload is paused');
        break;
      case 'running':
        console.log('Upload is running');
        break;
    }
  }, 
  (error) => {
    // Handle unsuccessful uploads
  }, 
  () => {
    // Handle successful uploads on complete
    // For instance, get the download URL: https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...
    getDownloadURL(uploadTask.snapshot.ref).then((downloadURL) => {
      console.log('File available at', downloadURL);
    });
  }
);
```




## To create or overwrite a single document, use the following language-specific set() methods:
- here db = getfirestore( )
- here in cites we add "users"
- here LA is user-uid generated by system
- inside this we create another doc which is used for search userchats

```
import { doc, setDoc } from "firebase/firestore"; 

// Add a new document in collection "cities"
await setDoc(doc(db, "cities", "LA"), {
  name: "Los Angeles",
  state: "CA",
  country: "USA"
 });
await setDoc(doc(db, "cities", "LA"),{})
});
```
